# l33tbot

## Summary

The one who know knows!

This is the source-code for l33t boot. Used for the l33t game in our irc channel.
Opensourced it here so people from this channel can continue to maintain it.

## Todo

I may setup a pipeline if there will be a lot of pull requests.


## Notes

Original bot framework can be found here, we just wrote a plugin for it to implement the l33t game.

l33t game plugin was just a quick hack to get something working without spend any time on it. So the code is not beautiful or clean. This was just 10-15 minutes of work to just get something working. Hopefuly someone on my IRC channel want to give more attention to this.
